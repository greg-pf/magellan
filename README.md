# Identifying Major Features in Terrain Imagery

## About

The aim of this project is to convert sattellite and other overhead terrain imager to a game board for use in strategy games like Settlers of Catan or Sid Meier's Civilization. 

Images are divided into triangular, square, or hexagonal tiles. Each tile is then assigned lables identifying the major terrain features realted to the game rules by the user. These features may include, but are not limited to: mountains, coastlines, islands, vegetation, and snow.
